# Research Papers

This directory contains research paper documents stored as text files for testing LLM adversarial steganographic attacks.

## Structure

- Store research papers as `.txt` files
- Each file should contain the full text of a research paper
- Papers can be used to test various steganographic attack prompts

## Adding Papers

To add a new research paper:
1. Convert the paper to plain text format
2. Save it with a descriptive filename (e.g., `nlp_transformers_2023.txt`)
3. Place it in this directory

## Sample Paper

A sample research paper (`sample_paper.txt`) is included as a reference for the expected format.
