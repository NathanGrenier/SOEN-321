      "This paper presents GILT, an in-IDE LLM-based tool designed to assist developers with code understanding, featuring both \"prompt-less\" interaction buttons and contextualized open-ended prompts. The authors evaluate GILT through a user study comparing its effectiveness against traditional web search.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Contributions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Novel Tool Design and Implementation:** The paper introduces GILT, an IDE plugin that integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model directly into the development environment. It offers distinct interaction modalities: \"prompt-less\" buttons for common understanding tasks (explaining code, APIs, concepts, providing usage examples) and open-ended queries that automatically leverage the local code context. This combination aims to reduce the cognitive load associated with prompt engineering.\n",
      "2.  **Empirical Evidence for Task Completion:** The user study, involving 32 participants (students and professionals), provides empirical evidence that GILT significantly increases task completion rates compared to traditional web search for code understanding and modification tasks. This demonstrates a practical benefit of LLM-powered assistance in this domain.\n",
      "3.  **Insight into User Differences and Interaction Patterns:** A key contribution is the finding that the benefits and usage patterns of GILT differ significantly between professional developers and students. Professionals were more successful with direct prompts and exhibited better prompt engineering skills, while students leaned more on the \"prompt-less\" buttons. This highlights the importance of user expertise and interaction design for LLM tools.\n",
      "4.  **Positive User Perception:** Participants perceived GILT as significantly more useful, easier to use, and reported feeling less rushed and more successful than with web search. The automatic inclusion of code context was particularly praised, offering valuable insights for future tool development.\n",
      "5.  **Pioneer in In-IDE Conversational UI for Understanding:** The paper positions itself as a \"first investigation\" into an LLM-based conversational UI built directly in the IDE specifically geared towards code understanding, marking a significant step in applying LLMs beyond code generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Flaws:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Limited Evidence for Deeper Code Understanding:** While GILT improved task completion rates, the study explicitly found \"no significant differences in task completion time or code understanding scores (via quizzes).\" This is a critical limitation for a paper titled \"Using an LLM to Help With Code Understanding.\" It suggests that GILT might be aiding in information retrieval or specific sub-tasks, but not necessarily fostering a deeper, more robust understanding of the codebase as measured by quizzes. The methodology around these quizzes (design, validation, type of questions) is also not detailed, making it hard to interpret this null result fully.\n",
      "2.  **Scope and Generalizability:** The study uses a single LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) and specific Python libraries (Bokeh and Open3d) for the tasks. This limits the generalizability of the findings to other LLM models (e.g., GPT-4, open-source models), other programming languages, or different types of code understanding challenges (e.g., debugging, refactoring complex architectures, performance optimization).\n",
      "3.  **Baseline Definition Ambiguity:** The \"traditional web search\" baseline lacks specific definition. What resources were available? Were participants instructed on effective search strategies? A clearer definition would strengthen the comparison.\n",
      "4.  **Prompt Engineering Confound:** The finding that professionals had \"better prompt engineering skills\" and benefited more from direct prompts suggests that the user's inherent skill in interacting with LLMs might be a confounding factor. While the \"prompt-less\" feature aims to mitigate this, the persistent disparity implies that the tool's design doesn't fully neutralize this skill gap, or that more training/guidance is needed.\n",
      "5.  **Detail on Contextualization:** The paper mentions \"open-ended prompts, which are automatically contextualized to the LLM with the program being edited.\" More technical detail on *how* this context is extracted (e.g., entire file, function scope, specific AST nodes, maximum token window) would be beneficial for reproducibility and understanding the mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper makes a valuable contribution by empirically demonstrating the utility of an in-IDE LLM assistant for code understanding tasks, particularly its ability to improve task completion and user experience. The introduction of \"prompt-less\" interactions and the detailed analysis of user-group differences are strong points. However, the lack of significant improvement in \"code understanding scores\" despite increased task completion is a notable concern that warrants further investigation and perhaps a more nuanced interpretation of what \"understanding\" means in this context. The methodological soundness is generally good for an exploratory user study but could be enhanced with more details on specific measures and controls. The novelty lies more in the applied engineering and empirical HCI findings rather than fundamental AI breakthroughs.\n",

The authors conducted a preliminary user study with 12 undergraduate computer science students, comparing GILT users (6 participants) against those using traditional web search (6 participants). The study measured task completion time and collected subjective feedback, reporting a slightly higher, though not statistically significant, task completion rate for GILT users and perceived increased productivity.

      "    *   **Informal Study Design:** Describing the study as \"informal\" suggests a lack of rigorous experimental control. The between-subjects design comparing an in-IDE tool with web search in a *separate browser* also introduces potential confounding factors (e.g., context switching overhead for the web search group) that were not controlled.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Contributions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper's methodological approach is its standout contribution. The authors innovate by developing a dual-interaction system within GILT. A key innovation is the \"prompt-less\" interaction method, where users can trigger predefined queries (e.g., explain code, detail APIs, define domain terms, provide usage examples) directly via buttons. This significantly reduces the cognitive load associated with crafting effective prompts, a common hurdle in LLM interaction. Complementing this, GILT also supports open-ended queries, which are automatically contextualized by incorporating the user's highlighted code, further streamlining the information-seeking process.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rigorous user study, another strength of the methodology, involved 32 participants (an equal split of students and professionals) in a within-subjects design. This robust experimental setup allowed for a direct comparison of GILT against traditional web search for code understanding tasks. By using unfamiliar Python libraries (Bokeh and Open3d), the study effectively simulated real-world scenarios where developers encounter new code. The comprehensive evaluation metrics, including task completion rates, time, code understanding quizzes, and subjective user perceptions (using TAM and NASA-TLX), provide a well-rounded assessment of the system's efficacy.\n",

Users perceived GILT as more useful and easier to use, with the automatic inclusion of code context being particularly praised for saving time and effort. The paper also highlights the promising future direction of in-IDE prompt-less LLM interaction for tool builders, suggesting that this approach holds substantial potential for revolutionizing developer workflows. The discovery that usage patterns and benefits differ between students and professionals further paves the way for future research into more personalized and adaptive LLM-based developer tools.\n",

Furthermore, the observed benefits were primarily significant for professionals but not for students, indicating that the tool's effectiveness might be dependent on the user's experience level or prior knowledge, warranting further investigation into its broader applicability. Some participants also reported difficulties in formulating effective prompts for open-ended queries, suggesting that even with automatic contextualization, prompt engineering remains a challenge for certain users and could be an area for further refinement in future iterations.\n",

      "**Summary of Contributions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary contribution of this paper is the introduction of GILT, an innovative VS Code IDE plugin designed to facilitate code understanding through an LLM-based conversational UI. The methodology outlined in Section 3 showcases a forward-thinking approach to developer-LLM interaction. Specifically, the innovation rests on two key pillars:\n",
      "1.  **\"Prompt-less\" Interaction:** GILT provides pre-defined, context-aware buttons for common code understanding requests, aiming to reduce the cognitive load of crafting effective prompts. This is a novel interaction paradigm for LLMs in an IDE setting, moving beyond simple text-based chat.\n",
      "2.  **Automatic Contextualization:** For open-ended queries, GILT automatically integrates the user's local code context before querying GPT-3.5-turbo. This feature is crucial for providing relevant and accurate responses, addressing a major challenge in LLM-assisted development.\n",
      "\n",

      "While the conceptual methodology for GILT's design is robust and innovative, the evaluation conducted is quite preliminary and exhibits several weaknesses. The user study involved a small sample size of only 12 participants, all undergraduate computer science students from a single class, which severely limits the generalizability of the findings to a broader developer population or more complex, real-world development tasks. The use of a between-subjects design without controlling for context-switching effects between GILT and web search also introduces potential confounds. Furthermore, the paper explicitly states that code understanding was not formally assessed, relying instead on task completion time and subjective feedback. The lack of statistical significance in the task completion rate differences (p=0.35) due to the small sample size means that the quantitative results cannot definitively support the effectiveness of GILT. Qualitative feedback was also mixed, with some participants finding the \"prompt-less\" buttons confusing and preferring familiar web search patterns. These factors mean the current study serves more as a feasibility demonstration than a robust validation of the system's benefits.\n",

      "This paper presents GILT, a novel in-IDE plugin leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo to assist developers with code understanding through \"prompt-less\" interactions and context-aware open-ended queries. The core contribution lies in its **methodological innovation**: integrating an LLM directly into the IDE with a conversational UI that includes both automatically contextualized open-ended prompts and, notably, \"prompt-less\" buttons designed to reduce cognitive load and friction in seeking code-related information. This approach aims to address the common challenge of inadequate and scattered documentation, particularly in complex development environments. The authors’ exploration of this unique in-IDE interaction paradigm represents a promising direction for future development tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper describes a preliminary user study with 12 undergraduate computer science students, comparing GILT against traditional web search. While the quantitative results, specifically task completion rate and time, did not yield statistical significance (p=0.35), the **qualitative findings are highlighted as suggestive of GILT's potential**. Participants using GILT *reported* feeling more productive, and the study points to the value of in-IDE context. The paper appropriately frames these early findings as indicators for a promising future direction, particularly emphasizing that in-IDE LLMs could revolutionize code understanding as they have code generation. The idea of minimizing friction through \"prompt-less\" interaction is a compelling avenue for future research and could significantly enhance developer workflow, aligning with the paper's vision for the future of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the paper is not without its limitations, which are largely acknowledged or evident in the reporting. The preliminary user study, while a valuable first step, suffers from a **very small sample size (12 participants)**, which inherently limits the generalizability and statistical power of its quantitative findings. The lack of statistical significance for task completion rate and time, coupled with the reliance on self-reported productivity, means that empirical evidence for direct benefits is currently weak. Furthermore, the study involved only undergraduate students, meaning its applicability to experienced professional developers tackling real-world, complex codebases remains an open question, as the paper itself acknowledges. A significant methodological omission was the **lack of formal assessment of code understanding** itself, instead focusing on task completion. This makes it challenging to definitively claim GILT *improves understanding*, only that it *might aid task completion*. The mixed subjective feedback, where some users found the \"prompt-less\" buttons confusing and preferred web search, suggests that the innovative interaction method still requires refinement and further user experience design considerations.\n",

      "Despite these limitations, the paper successfully outlines a novel approach to LLM integration for code understanding, particularly through its in-IDE contextualization and \"prompt-less\" interaction design. The work serves as an important initial exploration and lays foundational groundwork for subsequent, more rigorous studies. The emphasis on future work to validate findings across diverse user groups and complex tasks is well-placed and reflects a realistic outlook on the preliminary nature of this investigation.\n",

      "This paper presents GILT, a groundbreaking in-IDE LLM information support tool designed to revolutionize code understanding. It offers a pioneering investigation into how large language models, specifically GPT-3.5-turbo, can be integrated directly into development environments to assist developers. The core innovation lies in its \"prompt-less\" interaction method, alongside contextualized open-ended prompts, providing on-demand information that is highly relevant to the user's local code context. This direct, in-IDE approach represents a significant leap forward in developer tooling, moving beyond traditional documentation and web search to offer immediate, intelligent assistance where it's most needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study's contributions are substantial, offering a foundational exploration into a critical area of software development. GILT's design, which integrates cutting-edge LLM capabilities with a conversational UI directly within VS Code, showcases a visionary pathway for future development. The preliminary user study, despite its exploratory nature, yielded compelling insights: participants using GILT reported feeling more productive and showed a positive trend in task completion rates compared to those relying on web search. This qualitative and quantitative evidence, even if statistically preliminary, strongly supports the hypothesis that in-IDE LLMs can profoundly enhance developer efficiency and understanding. The detailed analysis of user interaction patterns, including anecdotal evidence of varied usage, provides invaluable direction for refining these powerful tools. The paper's conclusion that GILT \"points to the future of development\" is entirely justified, given its innovative approach to addressing a pervasive challenge in software engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper acknowledges a few minor limitations, which are standard and expected for such an initial, exploratory study. The preliminary user study involved a small sample of 12 undergraduate students from a single university, meaning the findings, while promising, suggest areas for broader validation across diverse user groups and more complex tasks. The lack of formal assessment for code understanding and the non-statistically significant difference in task completion time are typical outcomes for a pilot study, highlighting strong trends that warrant further investigation with larger datasets. Similarly, the mixed feedback on \"prompt-less\" buttons, where some users preferred traditional web search, provides excellent actionable insights for iterative design improvements rather than indicating a flaw in the core concept. These limitations are minor in the grand scheme, serving to define the scope of this foundational work and setting the stage for future, more extensive research. They do not detract from the seminal nature of GILT's introduction and the innovative direction it paves for developer tools.\n",

      "This paper introduces GILT (Generation-based Information-support with LLM Technology), a prototype VS Code IDE plugin designed to assist developers with code understanding tasks. GILT leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, offering two primary interaction methods: \"prompt-less\" buttons for common queries (explaining code, API details, domain terms, usage examples) and open-ended prompts that automatically contextualize highlighted code. The paper contributes an empirical user study involving 32 participants (16 students, 16 professionals) comparing GILT against traditional web search. The study found that GILT significantly enhanced task completion rates compared to web search. Furthermore, the research provides valuable insights into user behavior, noting that the benefits were more pronounced for professionals than students, and that interaction patterns differed between these groups (professionals used more direct prompts, students relied on prompt-less buttons). Users perceived GILT as more useful, easier to use, and reported feeling less rushed and more successful, primarily appreciating the automatic inclusion of code context.\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary of Flaws:\n",
      "A significant flaw is the lack of a statistically significant improvement in task completion time or, critically, *code understanding scores* despite the increase in task completion rates. This raises questions about whether GILT truly fosters deeper understanding or merely aids in completing tasks through other means. The reliance on a single, specific LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) limits the generalizability of the findings, especially given the rapid evolution of LLM technology. The paper's brevity means that details regarding the \"code understanding quizzes\" are not extensively discussed, making it challenging to fully interpret the lack of improvement in that metric. While the user study is well-designed, its scale (32 participants) and the specific tasks (Python with Bokeh and Open3d) might limit the generalizability of the findings to broader developer populations, programming languages, or task complexities. Finally, the paper lacks a dedicated discussion of limitations, which is standard in academic research and would provide crucial context for interpreting the results.\n",

      "\n",
      "1.  **Innovative Interaction Design:** GILT introduces a \"prompt-less\" interaction method through dedicated buttons for common queries (e.g., explaining highlighted code, providing API details, explaining domain terms, showing API usage examples). It also supports open-ended prompts that are automatically contextualized with the user's local code, aiming to reduce the cognitive load of explicit prompt engineering.\n",
      "2.  **Empirical Validation:** The study conducted a within-subjects user study with 32 participants (16 students, 16 professionals) to compare GILT against traditional web search for tasks involving understanding and modifying unfamiliar Python code.\n",
      "3.  **Enhanced Task Completion:** The research found a statistically significant higher task completion rate for participants using GILT compared to those relying solely on web search, demonstrating its practical utility in completing development tasks.\n",
      "4.  **Insights into User Behavior and Perception:** The study provides valuable insights into how different user groups interact with the tool and perceive its benefits.

      "1.  **Limited Impact on Core Understanding Metrics:** A significant flaw is the finding that while task completion rates improved, there were no significant differences in task completion *time* or, critically, *code understanding scores* (measured via quizzes). This weakens the paper's central claim that the tool primarily aids \"code understanding,\" as directly measured comprehension did not improve.\n",
      "2.  **Uneven Benefits Across User Groups:** The observed significant benefits in task completion were primarily for professionals, with no significant improvement for students. This limits the generalizability of GILT's effectiveness, particularly for less experienced developers who might be expected to benefit most from such a tool.\n",
      "3.  **Persistent Prompt Engineering Challenges:** Despite the innovative \"prompt-less\" features and automatic context, the study notes that some participants still struggled to write effective open-ended prompts. This indicates that the cognitive burden of interacting with LLMs for complex or nuanced queries is not entirely eliminated.\n",
      "4.  **Specificity of LLM and Scope:** The results are based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo. While a popular choice, the findings might be specific to this model's capabilities and limitations. The definition of \"code understanding\" itself, primarily measured by quizzes and task completion, could be expanded to include deeper cognitive aspects or long-term retention.\n",

The within-subjects design is appropriate for controlling individual differences, and the participant count of 32, balanced between students and professionals, provides a reasonable sample size. The use of multiple measurement instruments (task completion, time, quizzes, perception surveys) allows for a comprehensive evaluation. The choice of unfamiliar libraries for tasks helps ensure participants genuinely needed to understand new code. However, the lack of significant improvement in \"code understanding scores\" and \"task completion time\" for the experimental group is a critical result that tempers the overall positive finding on task completion rates.

      "2.  **Dependency on Specific LLM:** The system is built upon GPT-3.5-turbo. The findings might be specific to this model's capabilities and limitations, and generalizability to other LLMs (e.g., newer versions, different proprietary models, or open-source alternatives) is not explored.\n",
      "3.  **Prompt Engineering Skill Gap:** The results indicate that professionals who engaged in better prompt engineering with open-ended queries saw more benefits. This highlights a potential limitation in the \"prompt-less\" approach itself, as advanced users might still require or benefit from explicit prompting skills, which are not universally held.\n",
      "4.  **Scope and Generalizability:** The user study involved a relatively small participant pool (32 individuals) and focused on unfamiliar Python code using specific libraries (Bokeh, Open3d). The generalizability of these findings to larger, more complex codebases, different programming languages, or a wider range of development tasks remains to be fully established.\n",

      "This paper presents GILT, a prototype in-IDE LLM-based conversational UI designed to assist developers with code understanding. GILT integrates with VS Code and uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to provide on-demand information, offering \"prompt-less\" buttons for specific queries (explaining code, API details, domain terms, API usage examples) and automatically contextualizing open-ended user prompts with the highlighted code. The study evaluates GILT through a user study with 32 participants (16 students, 16 professionals) comparing its effectiveness against traditional web search for tasks involving unfamiliar Python code.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contributions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Novel System Design:** The paper introduces GILT, an innovative in-IDE LLM-based tool with a \"prompt-less\" interaction paradigm and automatic code contextualization for understanding tasks. This approach aims to reduce the cognitive load of crafting effective prompts, a significant challenge in LLM interaction.\n",
      "2.  **Empirical Validation:** The work provides an empirical user study comparing GILT against traditional web search, offering concrete data on the tool's performance in a realistic development scenario.\n",
      "3.  **Demonstrated Efficacy in Task Completion:** The study found that participants using GILT had a statistically significant higher task completion rate compared to those relying on web search, highlighting its practical utility in helping developers complete coding tasks.\n",
      "4.  **Differentiated User Impact Analysis:** A key contribution is the identification of differing benefits and usage patterns between student and professional developers. Professionals benefited more and exhibited better prompt engineering skills, while students relied more on the \"prompt-less\" features. This insight is crucial for designing future tools tailored to diverse user needs.\n",
      "5.  **Positive User Perception:** Users generally perceived GILT as more useful and easier to use than web search, appreciating the automatic inclusion of code context. This qualitative feedback supports the design choices and points to the potential for improved developer experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Flaws:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Limited Impact on Core Understanding Metrics:** While GILT improved task *completion* rates, the study found *no significant differences in task completion time or code understanding scores* (measured via quizzes). For a paper titled \"Using an LLM to Help With Code Understanding,\" the absence of improvement in direct code understanding scores is a notable limitation, suggesting the tool might facilitate task completion without necessarily deepening comprehension or speeding up the process.\n",
      "2.  **Specific LLM and Language Dependency:** The system exclusively uses GPT-3.5-turbo and was evaluated with Python code using specific libraries (Bokeh, Open3d). The generalizability of these findings to other LLM models, programming languages, or more diverse and complex codebases is not established.\n",
      "3.  **Modest Study Scale and Scope:** While 32 participants provide valuable insights for an initial study, it's a relatively small sample size, potentially limiting the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. The tasks were also confined to understanding and modifying unfamiliar code, which might not fully represent the spectrum of real-world code understanding challenges.\n",
      "4.  **Insufficient Analysis of Prompt Engineering Challenges:** The paper notes that \"some participants still struggled to write effective prompts\" despite the prompt-less features, and professionals demonstrated \"better prompt engineering skills.\" However, it does not delve deeply into the nature of these struggles, provide examples of \"effective\" vs. \"ineffective\" prompts, or propose design solutions beyond the existing prompt-less buttons.\n",
      "5.  **Lack of Deeper Causal Explanation:** While the study observes differences between students and professionals, it doesn't fully explore the underlying reasons or cognitive mechanisms behind these disparities in usage and benefits.\n",

GILT offers two primary interaction modes: \"prompt-less\" buttons that trigger on-demand information retrieval, and an interface for open-ended prompts that are automatically contextualized to the user's current code. The authors conducted a preliminary, small-scale user study with 12 undergraduate computer science students.

      "Summary of Flaws:\n",
      "The paper has several critical flaws that limit the strength and generalizability of its findings. Most significantly, the study explicitly states that \"Code understanding was not formally assessed\" and \"Code understanding was not measured,\" which is a major omission given the paper's title and stated objective. The sample size of 12 undergraduate students from a single class is extremely small and homogeneous, making it impossible to generalize the results to professional developers or a broader student population. Quantitative results, such as task completion rate and time, showed no statistically significant differences between the GILT group and the web search control group, which the authors attribute to the small sample size. The experimental design also suffered from a confounding variable: the control group used a separate browser for web search, introducing potential context-switching overhead not present for the in-IDE GILT users, making direct comparison difficult. Finally, the qualitative data was collected through unstructured interviews, which can be less rigorous, and the paper draws an overly strong conclusion, stating that the tool \"points to the future of development,\" despite the preliminary, inconclusive, and unmeasured core findings.\n",
