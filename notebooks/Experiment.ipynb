    "##  Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "**REQUIRED BEFORE RUNNING:**\n",
    "1. **Ollama server must be running**\n",
    "   - Start with: `ollama serve`\n",
    "   - Default: `http://localhost:11434`\n",
    "   - The notebook will check connection automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Required models must be downloaded**\n",
    "   - `ollama pull qwen3:4b`\n",
    "   - `ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b`\n",
    "   - `ollama pull gemma2:9b`\n",
    "   - `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`\n",
    "   - The notebook will check availability and list missing models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PDF files must be in the correct directory**\n",
    "   - Place research papers in `../research_papers_PDF/`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **RAG Toggle** \n",
    "- Set `USE_RAG = True` for **RAG mode** (chunks PDF, retrieves relevant sections)\n",
    "- Set `USE_RAG = False` for **FULL-TEXT mode** (sends entire PDF, no limits)\n",
    "- Full text mode not fully functional and tested\n",
    "\n",
    "### **RAG Mode** \n",
    "- Chunks PDF into segments with embeddings\n",
    "- Retrieves only relevant chunks based on evaluation prompt\n",
    "- Useful for very large documents or when context window is limited\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Full-Text Mode**\n",
    "- Extracts and sends **entire PDF** to LLM (all pages, no character limits)\n",
    "- Best for comprehensive evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ensure prerequisites are met** (Ollama running, models downloaded)\n",
    "2. **Set RAG mode** in configuration cell (`USE_RAG = True/False`)\n",
    "3. **Run evaluation tests** (numeric or categorical)\n",
    "4. **Check results** in the `../results/` directory\n",
